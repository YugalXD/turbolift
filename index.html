<p>Turbolift Files to Rackspace Cloud Files
-Swift-================================================</p>

<h2>
<a name="general-overview" class="anchor" href="#general-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Overview</h2>

<p>If you have found yourself in a situation where you needed or wanted to
upload a whole bunch of files to Cloud Files quickly, this is what you
are looking for. Turbolift is an assistant for uploading files to the
the Rackspace Cloud Files Repository with a bunch of options.</p>

<p>You'll also probably want to read <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/cf-devguide-latest.pdf">The Rackspace Cloud Files API
guide</a>
(PDF) : The guide will provide you an overview of all of the available
functions for Cloud Files.</p>

<p>The Process by which this application works is simple. All you have to
do is Literally fill in the command line arguments and press enter. The
application is a multiprocessing Cloud Files Uploader which will upload
any directory or file provided to it.</p>

<p>Functions of the Application :
:   -   Upload a directory, (recursively)
    -   Upload a single file
    -   Upload a local directory (recursively) and sync it with a Cloud
        Files Container
    -   Download a Container to a local directory
    -   Download changed objects from a Container to a local directory
    -   Compresses a Local Directory, then uploads it
    -   List all Containers
    -   List all Objects in a Container
    -   Delete an Object in a Container
    -   Delete an entire Container
    -   Clone one Container in one region to another Container in the
        same or Different Region.
    -   Set Custom headers on Objects/Containers</p>

<p>Turbolift can be managed with a config file. The option
<code>--system-config</code> references a config file. Additionally, the
Environment Variable <code>TURBO_CONFIG</code> can be used to reference a config
file as well. All of Turbolift's options can be set in the config file.
This makes managing Turbolift very simple.</p>

<p>Please read
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Command-Line-Args">command_line_args</a>
for more information on Command Line Arguments and functions.</p>

<p>If you would like to setup Turbolift to use an environment variable file
I would recommend you have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Turbolift.rc-Example">turboliftrc_example</a>
file and the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Environment-Vars">environment_vars</a>
document.</p>

<p>Please also review the <a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki">Turbolift
Wiki</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Prerequisites :
:   -   For all the things to work right please make sure you have
        <code>python-dev</code>.
    -   All systems require the <code>python-setuptools</code> package.
    -   Python =&gt; 2.6 but &lt; 3.0
    -   A File or some Files you want uploaded</p>

<p>Installation :
:   Installation is simple:</p>

<pre><code>    git clone git://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift.git
    cd turbolift
    python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>Installation NOTICE :
:   If you are installing on a system that is not Running Python =&gt; 2.6
    but &lt; 3.0, please review the document
    <a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Install-Embed-Ubuntu">INSTALL_EMBED</a>.
    This is a tested installation of Turbolift on Ubuntu 8.04, which
    ships with Python 2.5. The guide is a simple walk through for
    compiling stand alone python and installing Turbolift in that stand
    alone installation.</p>

<p>Python Modules Needed, for full operation :
:   NOTE : All of the modules needed should be part of the "standard"
    Library as of Python 2.6. The setup file will install the two needed
    dependencies which may not have made it onto your system.</p>

<h2>
<a name="application-usage" class="anchor" href="#application-usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Application Usage</h2>

<p>Here is the Basic Usage</p>

<pre lang="sourceCode"><code>turbolift -u [CLOUD-USERNAME] -a [CLOUD-API-KEY] --os-rax-auth [REGION] upload -s [PATH-TO-DIRECTORY] -c [CONTAINER-NAME]
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>turbolift -h</code> for a full list of available flags and operations</p>

<p>Turbolift can easily be set to run on via script or as a CRON job,
please see,
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Example-Script">turbolift_example_script</a>
for more ideas / information on using Turbolift as a script.</p>

<h2>
<a name="systems-tested-on" class="anchor" href="#systems-tested-on"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Systems Tested on</h2>

<p>The application has been tested on :
:   -   Debian 6
    -   Ubuntu 10.04 - 12.04
    -   Mac OS X 10.8
    -   CentOS[RHEL] 6</p>

<p>Known Limitations:
:   1.  Turbolift does not use SLO / DLO on files larger than 5GB in
        size. If you have a file that you would like uploaded that is
        larger than 5GB in size you will need to chunk the file prior to
        uploading at this time. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_large_objects.html">SLO / DLO
        docs</a>
        for more information on Large Object storage.</p>
