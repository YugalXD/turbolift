{"name":"Turbolift","tagline":"If you have found yourself in a situation where you needed to upload, download, delete, modify, or checkout a whole bunch of files/objects, this is what you are looking for. Turbolift is a client which was designed to access Cloud Files - Swift - quickly.","body":"Turbolift, the Cloud Files Uploader\r\n===================================\r\n\r\ndate\r\n:   2013-09-05 09:51\r\n\r\ntags\r\n:   rackspace, upload, mass, Cloud Files, files, api\r\n\r\ncategory\r\n:   \\*nix\r\n\r\nTurbolift Files to Rackspace Cloud Files\r\n-Swift-================================================\r\n\r\nGeneral Overview\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIf you have found yourself in a situation where you needed or wanted to\r\nupload a whole bunch of files to Cloud Files quickly, this is what you\r\nare looking for. Turbolift is an assistant for uploading files to the\r\nthe Rackspace Cloud Files Repository with a bunch of options.\r\n\r\nYou'll also probably want to read [The Rackspace Cloud Files API\r\nguide](http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/cf-devguide-latest.pdf)\r\n(PDF) : The guide will provide you an overview of all of the available\r\nfunctions for Cloud Files.\r\n\r\nThe Process by which this application works is simple. All you have to\r\ndo is Literally fill in the command line arguments and press enter. The\r\napplication is a multiprocessing Cloud Files Uploader which will upload\r\nany directory or file provided to it.\r\n\r\nFunctions of the Application :\r\n:   -   Upload a directory, (recursively)\r\n    -   Upload a single file\r\n    -   Upload a local directory (recursively) and sync it with a Cloud\r\n        Files Container\r\n    -   Download a Container to a local directory\r\n    -   Download changed objects from a Container to a local directory\r\n    -   Compresses a Local Directory, then uploads it\r\n    -   List all Containers\r\n    -   List all Objects in a Container\r\n    -   Delete an Object in a Container\r\n    -   Delete an entire Container\r\n    -   Clone one Container in one region to another Container in the\r\n        same or Different Region.\r\n    -   Set Custom headers on Objects/Containers\r\n\r\nTurbolift can be managed with a config file. The option\r\n`--system-config` references a config file. Additionally, the\r\nEnvironment Variable `TURBO_CONFIG` can be used to reference a config\r\nfile as well. All of Turbolift's options can be set in the config file.\r\nThis makes managing Turbolift very simple.\r\n\r\nPlease read\r\n[command\\_line\\_args](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Command-Line-Args)\r\nfor more information on Command Line Arguments and functions.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to setup Turbolift to use an environment variable file\r\nI would recommend you have a look at the\r\n[turboliftrc\\_example](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Turbolift.rc-Example)\r\nfile and the\r\n[environment\\_vars](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Environment-Vars)\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nPlease also review the [Turbolift\r\nWiki](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites :\r\n:   -   For all the things to work right please make sure you have\r\n        `python-dev`.\r\n    -   All systems require the `python-setuptools` package.\r\n    -   Python =\\> 2.6 but \\< 3.0\r\n    -   A File or some Files you want uploaded\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n:   Installation is simple:\r\n\r\n        git clone git://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift.git\r\n        cd turbolift\r\n        python setup.py install\r\n\r\nInstallation NOTICE :\r\n:   If you are installing on a system that is not Running Python =\\> 2.6\r\n    but \\< 3.0, please review the document\r\n    [INSTALL\\_EMBED](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Install-Embed-Ubuntu).\r\n    This is a tested installation of Turbolift on Ubuntu 8.04, which\r\n    ships with Python 2.5. The guide is a simple walk through for\r\n    compiling stand alone python and installing Turbolift in that stand\r\n    alone installation.\r\n\r\nPython Modules Needed, for full operation :\r\n:   NOTE : All of the modules needed should be part of the \"standard\"\r\n    Library as of Python 2.6. The setup file will install the two needed\r\n    dependencies which may not have made it onto your system.\r\n\r\nApplication Usage\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nHere is the Basic Usage\r\n\r\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\r\nturbolift -u [CLOUD-USERNAME] -a [CLOUD-API-KEY] --os-rax-auth [REGION] upload -s [PATH-TO-DIRECTORY] -c [CONTAINER-NAME]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `turbolift -h` for a full list of available flags and operations\r\n\r\nTurbolift can easily be set to run on via script or as a CRON job,\r\nplease see,\r\n[turbolift\\_example\\_script](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Example-Script)\r\nfor more ideas / information on using Turbolift as a script.\r\n\r\nSystems Tested on\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe application has been tested on :\r\n:   -   Debian 6\r\n    -   Ubuntu 10.04 - 12.04\r\n    -   Mac OS X 10.8\r\n    -   CentOS[RHEL] 6\r\n\r\nKnown Limitations:\r\n:   1.  Turbolift does not use SLO / DLO on files larger than 5GB in\r\n        size. If you have a file that you would like uploaded that is\r\n        larger than 5GB in size you will need to chunk the file prior to\r\n        uploading at this time. Please refer to the [SLO / DLO\r\n        docs](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_large_objects.html)\r\n        for more information on Large Object storage.\r\n\r\nFor information on Benchmarks from my own testing, please have a look\r\nhere at the\r\n[benchmarks](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift/wiki/Benchmarks)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nTurbolift is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\r\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the\r\nFree Software Foundation.
